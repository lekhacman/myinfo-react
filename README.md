# MyInfo Demo App in React
MyInfo demo app in ReactJS + Redux (front-end part)

Featuring:

- 100% coverage with unit/integration testing (Jest)
- Functional programming with Ramda! Yeah!
- Java/Go/... back-end

# Motivation
The original MyInfo demo app is boring and doesn't look like the way it is in the real world.
Don't get me wrong, I admire the authors of the original app as they are amazing in keeping things simple
and writing the app in vanilla JavaScript.

Furthermore, in the "enterprise" world,
the back-end is usually written in Java, C#, or Golang instead of NodeJS.

Although I'm more of a JavaScript gang, I like to experiment with different programming languages.
So I wrote back-end MyInfo client apps to use in pair with this front-end app:

- [MyInfo Demo App in Rust](https://github.com/lekhacman/myinfo-rust)
- ...to be continued
